## üìã Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a fully connected neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The implementation leverages TensorFlow and Keras to construct a deep learning model that learns to recognize handwritten digits (0‚Äì9). The notebook also includes systematic hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner to optimize model performance.

- **Dataset:** MNIST (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images, 28x28 grayscale, 10 classes)
- **Goal:** Classify handwritten digits with high accuracy using a robust, regularized MLP
- **Skills Showcased:** Data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and analysis

## üìä Results

The model achieves the following performance (see [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/evangelosgakias/fcnn-image-classification-tensorflow) for full details):

| Model              | Test Accuracy | Test Loss |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Original Model     | ~98%         | ~0.07     |
| Fine-Tuned Model   | ~98.2%       | ~0.06     |

- **Validation accuracy and loss closely track training metrics, indicating good generalization.**
- **Confusion matrices show most predictions are correct, with errors concentrated in visually ambiguous digits.**
- **Fine-tuned model offers a slight but consistent improvement over the baseline.**
